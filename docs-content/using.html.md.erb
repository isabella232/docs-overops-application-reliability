This topic describes how to use **OverOps Reliability Platform for PCF**.

##<a id='prereqs'></a> Prerequisites

1. You must use `java-buildpack` for your application.

1. You must enable TCP routing. See [HTTP vs. TCP Domains
](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/routes-domains.html#http-vs-tcp-shared-domains) and [Enabling TCP Routing](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/adminguide/enabling-tcp-routing.html).

##<a id='using'></a> Using OverOps Reliability Platform for PCF

Once the Tile is installed and the Configuration instructions have been done, in the top left hand corner of the screen should show `OverOps is Active`. Clicking this button will bring a pop up of all the collectors and agents currently running. 
##<a id='connect'></a> Connect OverOps Collector to Agent

1. [Create a TCP shared domain](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/routes-domains.html#-create-a-shared-domain) if you have not already created one.

     ```
     cf create-shared-domain tcp.example.com --router-group default-tcp
      ```

1. [Map a route](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/routes-domains.html#-manually-map-a-route) to the OverOps Collector that was deployed during your tile upload.

     ```
     cf map-route overops-collector tcp.example.com --random-port
     ```

     Using `--random-port` instructs Pivotal Cloud Foundry to pick a port for your route. To set a specific port use `--port 1234`.

1. [Create a user-provided service](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/user-provided.html) to enable the Takipi Agent Framework and deliver the Collector hostname and port to your application.

      ```
      cf cups takipi-service -t "takipi" -p '{"collector_host":"tcp.example.com", "collector_port":"1234"}'
      ```

1. Bind `takipi-service` to your application.

      ```
      cf bind-service app_name takipi-service
      ```

1. Restage your application.

      ```
      cf restage app_name
      ```

1. Once the service is bound, confirm connectivity with the OverOps Analysis Server.

1. Ensure that your application is deployed and ensure it is using the [Java Buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack.git) or the Offline Java Buildpack.

1. [Map a route](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/routes-domains.html#internal-routes) to the collector that was deployed. Use the apps.internal domain in your environment to ensure your collector is not accessible from outside sources.

     ```
     cf map-route overops-collector apps.internal --hostname collector
     ```
1. Once a route is mapped, enable [container to container communication](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/devguide/deploy-apps/cf-networking.html) using a network policy. 
    
    ```
    cf add-network-policy app_name --destination-app overops_collector_name --protocol tcp --port 8080
    ```

1. [Create a user-provided service](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/user-provided.html) to enable the Takipi Agent Framework and deliver the Collector hostname and port to your application.

      ```
      cf cups takipi-service -t "takipi" -p '{"collector_host":"collector.apps.internal", "collector_port":"8080"}'
      ```
      
      <%= image_tag("screenshots/ups_example_config.png") %>

1. Bind `takipi-service` to your application.

      ```
      cf bind-service app_name takipi-service
      ```

1. Restage your application.

      ```
      cf restage app_name
      ```

1. Once the service is bound, confirm connectivity with the OverOps Analysis Server.
